Stability Analysis of the Reduced System

KINETIC STABILITY ANALYSIS
The linear stability analysis based on the eigenvalues
of the Jacobian matrix is only valid for steady states.

Summary:
This state is asymptotically stable,
transient states in its vicinity have oscillatory components.

Eigenvalue statistics:
 Largest real part: -0.120665
 Largest absolute imaginary part:  0.383222
 The complex eigenvalues with the largest real part are:  -0.202635 +|- 0.383222i
 2 are purely real
 0 are purely imaginary
 2 are complex
 0 are equal to zero
 0 have positive real part
 4 have negative real part
 stiffness = 38.7445
 time hierarchy = 0.268142
