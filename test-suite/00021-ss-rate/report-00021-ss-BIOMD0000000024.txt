Stability Analysis of the Reduced System

KINETIC STABILITY ANALYSIS
The linear stability analysis based on the eigenvalues
of the Jacobian matrix is only valid for steady states.

Summary:
This state 's stability is undetermined.

Eigenvalue statistics:
 Largest real part: 0
 Largest absolute imaginary part:  0
 0 are purely real
 0 are purely imaginary
 0 are complex
 0 are equal to zero
 0 have positive real part
 0 have negative real part
 stiffness = 0.000000
 time hierarchy = 0.000000
