Stability Analysis of the Reduced System

KINETIC STABILITY ANALYSIS
The linear stability analysis based on the eigenvalues
of the Jacobian matrix is only valid for steady states.

Summary:
This state is unstable,
transient states in its vicinity have oscillatory components.

 Largest real part: 0.223791
 Largest absolute imaginary part:  0.57495
 The complex eigenvalues with the largest real part are:  0.223791 +|- 0.57495i
 1 are purely real
 0 are purely imaginary
 2 are complex
 0 are equal to zero
 2 have positive real part
 1 have negative real part
 stiffness = 3.58053
 time hierarchy = 0.281684
